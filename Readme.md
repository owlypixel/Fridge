## What is this?
This project's purpose was to practice working with CSS variables. The idea is based on cool possibility of altering the root CSS variables from JavaScript. As for now, this is considered an experimental technology, so this won't work in browsers such as IE, EDGE, OperaMini or Android browser of older versions. 
You can play around and experiment with it [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/mONPoL) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### JS
- How to declare a variable and then change it's value using values provided by the range input
- Getting and setting properties for the root CSS variables
- Setting event listeners on mousemove

### CSS

- Creating a cool linear gradient for the body
